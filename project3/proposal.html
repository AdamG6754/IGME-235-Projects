    <h1>
        Project 3 Proposal: Underground Prototype.
    </h1>

    <img src="jumper1.png" alt = "">

    <h2>
        Underground is a beat-em-up game idea that started as a plan to teach myself more C# and Unity over the course
        of the
        academic year and summer.
    </h2>

    <h2>
        My project 3 will be a prototype "proof of concept" for the game, featuring the three main characters with
        different strengths, speeds, and martial arts styles: Violent Jack (Street fighting), Hunter Vo (Viet Vo Dao),
        and Nate Levitan (Krav Maga).
    </h2>

    <h3>
        My plan for the interactive experience is to have an open area for the player to walk around in with some
        destructable barrels and an enemy or two to fight (unlimited health for both the enemies and the players, the
        barrels "repair" after a second when broken). I also plan to implement written information about the currently
        selected character, like a bio, as well as taunt and "special attack" buttons if I
        have time to before the end of the project.
