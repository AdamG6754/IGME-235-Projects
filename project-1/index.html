            <span id="article"><span id="firstp">The biggest news to hit the movie world this year is that Harrison Ford
                    was making waves
                    as the new – but strangely old-fashioned – action hero, Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
                    <br><br></span>

                After coming to prominence in Star Wars, Ford whipped moviegoers worldwide into a frenzy in a film that
                brought back all the excitement and adventure of the swashbuckling films of Saturday matinees.<br>

                <span id="tab">Marking</span> the first collaboration between two of the world’s most successful
                movie-makers, Steven
                Spielberg and George Lucas, Raiders of the Lost Ark was a tribute to the cliff-hanging thrillers,
                westerns and serials of the 1930s and 1940s, while at the same time making ‘Indy’ loosely based upon
                19th Century archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni, a man famous for his exploration and excavation of Egyptian
                burial sites.<br>

                <span id="tab">While</span> Lucas produced, Spielberg directed the action with his trademark panache and
                helped the film reach
                a box-office gross of $242 million, making it the highest earner of the year – and this was a year that
                saw such notable features as a new James Bond film (for Your Eyes Only), Superman II and Terry Gilliam’s
                inspired fantasy, Time Bandits.<br>

                <span id="tab">As</span> the eponymous Dr. Jones, he donned his Han Solo gear for a brown fedora, short
                leather jacket and
                bullwhip. This trademark bull-whip, a device that served as a multi-function tool and weapon and proved
                invaluable as an aid to stealing ancient idols from their plinths as well as despatching the occasional
                Sherpa.<br>

                <span id="tab">The</span> story concept went back to the days of thrilling serials and saw Indy battling
                across continents in
                a bid to prevent the Nazis from stealing the mythical Ark of the Covenant – a religious icon so powerful
                that it could kill in the wrong hands. Mixing period drama with the supernatural allowed the FX house,
                Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), to shine, and with John Williams’ rousing score throughout, the movie
                proved to be a perfect piece of escapism using the styles and approach of the serials it sought to
                emulate. Certainly the Academy Awards seemed to think so, as Raiders of the Lost Ark was nominated in
                nine categories and won five, including Best Art Direction / Set Design, Best Sound, Best Film Editing,
                Best Effects / Visual Effects and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects editing.<br>

                <span id="tab">Taking</span> this as all the proof needed that they had a hit on their hands, Lucas and
                Spielberg started
                making plans to continue the series: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom would be next…</span>
