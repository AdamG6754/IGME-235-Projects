    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h2>
        This project felt very on and off for me, in the sense that it was done in essentially three "sprints" with no
        work in between. I think the biggest cause of confusion during this project was having to figure out how to use
        an API that didn't require a key, given that the only experience I had beforehand was the Giphy assignment,
        which required an API key. It may have just been this month in general, but I found it hard to focus on work
        that wasn't directly tied to my interests, so I think it was a good thing I made the topic of this assignment
        about Pokemon, since that allowed me to be more interested in seeing the project be more than "good enough". I
        also plan to share this site with others, and use this for another pet project of mine.

        All in all, I believe I did A range work on this project.
