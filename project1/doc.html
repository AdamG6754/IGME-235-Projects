    <div>
        After the initial prototyping criticism, I added a sticky navbar, implemented designs that made the page feel
        more like a comic book and otherwise feel better for the content, and made the page responsive to various screen
        sizes.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added transitions to the navbar.
        </li>
        <li>
            increased text sizes and spacing, as well as adding fonts that make the page look more like comic book text.
        </li>
        <li>
            rearranged the color scheme to match the images used, for a more visually satasfying page.
        </li>
        <li>
            altered the layout for mobile view to avoid "word salad"
        </li>
    </ul>
</body>
